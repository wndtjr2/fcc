msgid "The mission of Fashion Crowd Challenge (FCC) is to find and bring talented, hidden fashion stars into the spotlight of the world. To this end, FCC is introducing a new type of fashion design competition. Unlike typical design contests, design submissions in FCC are evaluated by general people and peer designers.<br>\nThe slogan of FCC is “Time to Think” about fashion. The purpose of our slogan is to empower the fashion-loving layperson to re-think their own senses of style and design, instead of having their opinions handed to them by the fashion industry.<br><br>\nFCC is open and accessible. Anyone, who is over 14 years old, can participate as a fashion designer and as a design judge.<br><br>\nFCC administrates the fashion design competition through its own unique algorithm called Crowd Evaluation System (CES). Founded upon the theory of the collective intelligence or crowd-wisdom, CES selects judges from both the public and peer designers, and manages the evaluation logistics to generate fair, unbiased, and constructive evaluations.<br><br>\nThroughout the course of the competition period, FCC highlights top designers based on the most highly evaluated design work for each day. Those selections will be displayed on the FCC website. After the competition period, FCC will publish the winners and release the full evaluation results as generated by the CES, giving each and every designer valuable feedback. In addition to these features, FCC will support a virtual community where designers can network with their fans in potential markets.<br><br>\nAs participation in FCC is free of charge and the potential benefits enormous, this is a no-risk, high-reward opportunity for people of all stripes to participate in the fashion community."
